La sequenza Q di Hofstadter è una sequenza ricorsiva definita come: 

    𝑄(1)=𝑄(2)=1

    𝑄(𝑛)=𝑄(𝑛−𝑄(𝑛−1))+𝑄(𝑛−𝑄(𝑛−2)) per n > 2

I primi termini della sequenza sono:

    1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8, 8, 10, 9, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 16, 14, 14, 16, 16, 16, 16, 20, 17, 17, 20, 21, 19, 20, 22, 21, 22, 23, 23, 24, 24, 24, 24, 24,  32, 24, 25, 30, 28, 26, 30, 30, 28, 32, 30, 32, 32, 32, 32, 40, 33, 31, 38, 35, 33, 39, 40, 37, 38, 40, 39, …
